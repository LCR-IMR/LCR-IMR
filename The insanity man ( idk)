- 👋 Hi, I’m @LCR-IMR (though my real nickname is IMR)
- 👀 I’m interested in a bunch of stuff, hehe. Ok i'll mention them. So my project here is making a terraria mod, and i'm doing a bit of coding, learning how to compose and some spriting
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make music with FL Studio, i'm still a beginner on it. But i will stay confident on it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing for now.
- 📫 How to reach me... well for now, there's no way you can reach me. but i have planned on having a discord, and also i will start posting in reddit and the terraria forums, about my terraria mod.
